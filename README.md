# Tiny Tapeout Verilog Project Template

- After reading Elon Musk discuss the efficiency trade-offs between integer and floating-point computation for Tesla AI5/AI6 chips, I thought of trying it myself on free ASIC tools here on TinyTapeout.
- Since I already have a fully-fledged [TPU](https://github.com/WilliamZhang20/ECE298A-TPU) that does 8-bit integer (INT8) arithmetic we should now do FP8.
- With the previous project, I had tried doing FP8 with BF16 accumulation, but the chip area blew up. In retrospect, this was likely because I took extra space converting BF16 to FP8.
- Later on in the previous project, I got rid of 8-bit outputs and kept every output in 16-bit numbers. So no more back-conversion waste, time to try it out again.

## What is Tiny Tapeout?

Tiny Tapeout is an educational project that aims to make it easier and cheaper than ever to get your digital and analog designs manufactured on a real chip.

To learn more and get started, visit https://tinytapeout.com.

## Set up your Verilog project

1. Add your Verilog files to the `src` folder.
2. Edit the [info.yaml](info.yaml) and update information about your project, paying special attention to the `source_files` and `top_module` properties. If you are upgrading an existing Tiny Tapeout project, check out our [online info.yaml migration tool](https://tinytapeout.github.io/tt-yaml-upgrade-tool/).
3. Edit [docs/info.md](docs/info.md) and add a description of your project.
4. Adapt the testbench to your design. See [test/README.md](test/README.md) for more information.

The GitHub action will automatically build the ASIC files using [LibreLane](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/librelane/).
